\section{Introduction}

    The recent decades have seen the growing utilization of specialized hardware for the purpose of extensive computing. 
    Right from general purpose CPUs to highly specialized hardware such as ASICs are being used in a wide variety of applications.
    When it comes to specialized hardwares there is an increasing usage of FPGAs especially due to its advantage of reprogrammability as per user's need.
    In this endeavor, to synthesize such FPGA, high level synthesis(HLS) tools have been introduced.
    HLS is a process of High Level Synthesis(HLS) is a process of mapping behavioral(C-like programs) models of hardware to low level(HDL-like programs) ones; which are then synthesized as specialized hardwares(eg: FPGA, ASIC). 
    HLS tools are used widespread in recent times due to the high demand for such specialized hardware than have better throughput and energy consumption for specific intensive computations(eg: in Machine Learning).

    However, HLS has been predominantly used/developed for sequential programs. 
    The last few years have been investigated in terms of synthesizing concurrent programs; how would specialized hardware be synthesized that reflects concurrency.
    However, not much investigation has been done when it comes to synthesis of fine-grained concurrent programs; commonly known as lock-free programs.
