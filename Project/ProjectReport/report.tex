    \section{Conclusions}
    %Summarize what was done 
    I tried to address the scheduling problem of fine grained concurrent programs. 
    Previous work have placed no resource constraint while addressing this problem.
    I viewed the resource constraint problem as an optimization that can be done at the behavioral model level before scheduling.
    The optimization helped in addressing the resource constraint problem on most programs considered for benchmarking. 
    It was noted that different variants of the optimization may be required to get least required resources.
